This repository contains PKGBUILD scripts for the Arch Linux GNU/Linux 
distribution. They can be downloaded to a new directory of choosing
and run via "makepkg -s" much like the PKGBUILDs from official Arch
Linux repositories and AUR. 

Some of the PKGBUILDs will be submitted to AUR at some point, but 
the copies will be kept here to make introducing changes easier.

Consider this repository a "development playground". Use at own risk!
Any and all feedback would be highly welcomed.
