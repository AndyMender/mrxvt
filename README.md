This repository contains PKGBUILD scripts for the Arch Linux GNU/Linux 
distribution and its derivatives. The repository can be cloned as is
and packages built by calling "makepkg -s". Bear in mind this requires
the "base-devel" metapackage or individual components listed in
specific PKGBUILDs.. 

Some of the PKGBUILDs will be submitted to AUR at some point, but 
the copies will be kept here to make introducing changes easier.

Consider this repository a "development playground". Use at own risk!
Any and all feedback would be highly welcomed.
